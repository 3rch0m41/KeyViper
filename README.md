# KeyViper
This is a basic example of a keylogger, many features still missing
If run this code will create a txt file in the path C:\temp\ called keystroke.txt and will contain the list of all the keyboard stroke made by the victim. 



## Missing Features
- Integration with the web -> Publishing the list on the web for the attacker easy access

#### This is a demostration only. Any misuse will be not charged to me.
